Data meter
step 1:
    first need to do a particular input
        input:
                9000600600|InAir1234|0|13456|No
        output:
               Mobile Number| 4G | 5G    | 4G Roaming| 5G Roaming| Cost
                9000600600  | 0  | 13456 | 0         | 0         | 123
        step 1.1    -   parser.ParseData.parse()
            * create a parser which split the input line using '|'

        step 1.2    -   models.UsageRecorde
            * create a data model class where object for each parsed input is created so can be reused in other area
            (aggregate ,cost ) -->name it as record

        step 1.3    -   calculate.calculateCost.Calculate()
            * now using created object "record" find the cost

step 2:
    create git repo and push the current version

step 3:
    create a file having various mobile numbers
        using bufferedreader with filereader with IOException to catch the errors

step 4:
    NOW REAL TASK:create files based on month and need to display all in the below format

            Mobile Number|4G|5G|4G Roaming|5G Roaming|Cost

    Step 4.1:
        *so 1st do it for "january" month

        step 4.1.1:
            *need to create a model     -models.UsageSummary
                -In that pass UsageRecord models objects for a particular number
                -so need some way to aggregate based on mobile numbers and with its record aggregation

        step 4.1.2  -in app.java
                -read a line from "january.java"
                -parse the data using "Parsedata" it return a UsageRecord (object)
                -get a mobilenumber(obj.getmobilenumber()) and pass a record(object) to UsageSummary
                    -use hashmap <mobilenumber,UsageSummary<records>>
